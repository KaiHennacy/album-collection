                    Thank you. (Brian, I could use a little bit more monitor). Hello hello (can't you turn it up any more than that?) Hello hello... Hey! Alright! Pardon me, folks. The name of this song is "Penguin in Bondage," an' it's a song that, uh, deals with the possible variations on a basic theme which is... well, you understand what the basic theme is. And then the variations include, uh, manoeuvres that might be executed with the aid of, uh, extra-terrestrial gratification and devices which might or might not be supplied in a local department store or perhaps a drugstore but at very least in one of those fancy new shops that they advertise in the back-pages of the free press. This song suggests to the suggestible listener that the ordinary procedure, uh, that I'm circumlocuting at this present time in order to get this text on television, is that, uh, if you wanna do something other than what you thought you were gonna do when you first took your clothes off and you just happened to have some DEVICES around... then it's, it's not only okay to get into the PARAPHERNALIA of it all but... hey! What did he say? Ready?
                    
                    She's just like a Penguin in Bondage, boy
                    Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh...

                    Way over on the wet side
                    Of the bed (Knirps for moisture)
                    
                    Just like the mighty Penguin
                    Flappin' her eight ounce wings
                    (The Penguin Flap)
                    
                    Lord, you know it's all over
                    If she come atcha on the strut & wrap 'em all around yer head
                    Flappin' her eight ounce wings, flappinumm
                    
                    She's just like a Penguin in Bondage, boy
                    
                    Shake up the pale-dry
                    Ginger ale
                    
                    Tremblin' like a Penguin
                    When the battery fail
                    
                    Lord, you must be havin' her jumpin' through a hoopa real fire
                    With some Kleenex wrapped around a coat-hang wire
                    
                    She's just like a Penguin in Bondage, boy
                    Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh...
                    Rennenhenninnahenninneninahenn
                    Howlin' over to some
                    Antarcticulated moon
                    
                    In the frostbite nite
                    With her flaps gone white
                    Shriekin' as she spot the hoop across the room
                    (Everytime she sees the hoop)
                    
                    You know it must be a Penguin bound down
                    If you hear that terrible screamin' and there ain't no other
                    Birds around
                    
                    She's just like a Penguin in Bondage, boy
                    Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh...
                    She's just like a Penguin in Bondage, boy
                    Oh yeah, Oh yeah, Oh...

                    Aw, you must be careful
                    Not to leave her straps
                    TOO LOOSE
                    
                    'Cause she just might box yer dog
                    She just might box yer doggie
                    An' leave you a dried-up dog biscuit...</p>
